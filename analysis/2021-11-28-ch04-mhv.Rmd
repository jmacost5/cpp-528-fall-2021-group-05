## Data File

**Data Manipulation Information**


The data used in the test was derived from the LTDB-2000, LTDB-2010, and LTDB-META-DATA datasets that can be found at https://github.com/R-Class/cpp-528-fall-2021-group-05/tree/main/data/rodeo. Code for the data manipulation steps can be found at https://github.com/R-Class/cpp-528-fall-2021-group-05/labs/wk05lab_05_source-1.R  

* Step 1:  The data was wrangled from the three separate data sources and was merged into a singular data frame to allow for easy data manipulation and visualization. The data frame was filtered to keep the urban tracts only.

* Step 2: To add the NMTC and LIHTC data to the data frame a few prerequisite steps had be completed. The first step was to create a unique id to ensure one id was allocated per tract; the unique ids were created as a numerical value.

* Step 3: The value variable in the data set needed to be converted to a numeric variable, therefore the dollar sign and comma were removed, and the variable was converted to a numeric value.

* Step 4: The NMTC and LIHTC cleaned data needed to be merged into the main data frame. The variables select from the NMTC and LIHTC to me merged into the main data frame were the value, unique id, and tract id variables. With the NMTC and LIHTC data merged into the main data frame, the null or NA values needed to be converted to a 0 (zero) numerical value.

* Step 5: The median home values in 2000 were adjusted to 2010 inflated values by using the inflation rate constant of 1.28855. The new adjusted rates were added to the variable mhv.00 and the 2010 values were added to the variable mhv.10.

* Step 6: A new variable mhv.change was created by finding the difference between the 2010 home values (mhv.10) and the inflation adjusted 2000 home values (mhv.00).

* Step 7: To add precision to the analysis and avoid unrealistic growth rates the inflation adjusted to remove outliers; 2000 home values below $10,000 were removed. A new variable mhv.growth was created to show the home value change as a percentage. All the new variables were added to the main dataframe.

* Step 8: To reduce the size of the main dataframe, only variables that were of interest to the analysis were selected and ones that were not of interest were dropped from the main dataframe.

* Step 9: The selected variables from the previous step were then converted into percentages and stored into new variables for further analysis.  


## Variables effect on Neighborhood Improvement

Below is a log-linear diff-in-diff model which compares MHV with the NMTC, and LIHTC programs.  The treatment of the model includes application of either the NMTC or LIHTC programs with the census variables of change in vacancy rates, change in unemployment rates, and change in household income.  The additional variables have all been logged to align with a growth measurement over time related to a growth measurement of Median Home Value over time.
